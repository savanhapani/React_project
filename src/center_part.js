      <p>The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.</p>
      <div>It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.</div> 
      <div>A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.</div>
